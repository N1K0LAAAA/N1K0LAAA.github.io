# About Me
Hi I am Nikola. Here is a short summary of who i am and what you can expect from me:

## Who Am I?
I'm just a nerd interested in all fields of computer science and I do a lot of projects in different areas.
## Why did I create this Blog?
I created this blog so i can actually finish a lot of my projects and not have 20 Diffrent projects in 20 diffrent languages and in diffrent areas. And I can also learn how to write blogs and maybe teach you something here and there.

## What to Expect?
Like i said before I like sticking my nose everywhere so you will  see anything here really  from malware development to making game mods , or me writting algorithms for fun or just building some cool stuff that i want to do.
