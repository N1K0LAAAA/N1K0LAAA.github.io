# Introduction
In this Blog I will be writing a few sorting algorithms, visualizing them, and showing the mathematics behind each algorithm.


# Bubble Sort


# Selection Sort


# Insertion Sort


# Quick Sort


# Randomsort (Theoretically the Fastest One)


# Visualization


# Side by Side Comparasion
